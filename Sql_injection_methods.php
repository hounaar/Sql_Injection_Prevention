// Methods #1 : You can use PDO connection rather than mysqli

We can use store procedrures in order to do the query. However it will reduce and prevent SQL Injection 
We can use store procedures like the ways below because unlike SQLServer defining store procedures is a bit diffrent in PHP

Follow the specific Database escaping.

Method #6:

A somewhat special case of escaping is that the method of hex-encode the complete string received from 
the user (this may be seen as escaping each character). the online application ought to hex-encode the user input before as well as it within the SQL statement.
The SQL statement should take into consideration this fact, and consequently compare the informatio

Use canned expressions and parameter queries. These are SQL statements that are sent to  
the database server and analyzed separately from the parameters. This prevents an attacker from injecting malicious SQL.
